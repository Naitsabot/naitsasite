# Team Coheasion Tool (Spring 2024)

The second semester of the software bachelor focuses on internet web development (or the intorduction to it at least) and describing algorithems.

This project attempts to corrolate team-members free time and their interests in activities with the end result of suggesting dates and activities.

For this a basic SPA was written with Node.js Express.js (and just that) for team-members to log onto and give appropiate information, and show results of calculations.

## Abstract

The aim of this project is to investigate how to increase team cohesion, which is assumed to be possible by enhancing social cohesion among peers. The target group of this project is Computer Science students at Aalborg University for multiple reasons, but mostly because they typically are more introverted, and since they frequently work in groups, it is crucial to strengthen this cohesion. To achieve the goal of enhancing social cohesion, a web application has been developed to assist in coordinating social activities based on the personal preferences specified by each team member. The application will suggest the optimal time interval, a specific activity, and show available team members. The core functionality of the application has been developed and works as intended, theoretically increasing the team cohesion in the target group. Thereby obtaining the objective of this project.
