# Chargepoint Placement finder (Fall 2023)

This is the first (well second, but thats besides the point) semester project of a total of six in my software bachelor. A requirement from the study regulations for the was to write the project in C. As it is the first project the focus is on basic imperative practices.

This project takes focuses on the placement of chargers for electric vehicles. This is to be done by developing a program that can map out the ideal placements of the chargers.

## Abstract

The continued growth and adoption of electric vehicles (EV) comes with an increase in the demand for EV charging stations. This paper discusses and considers the different factors that go into making a location "optimal" for an EV charging station, to provide adequate infrastructure to prevent range anxiety from being a prevalent factor in the consideration of transitioning to an electric vehicle. Additionally, we’ve designed and presented a product, meant to assist in the decision-making process, of placing EV chargers, from an organizational point of view. This product is then tested on a data set assembled from real-life data, acquired from the Danish Transport Authority, whereafter an evaluation of the results is conducted.
