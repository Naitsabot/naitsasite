# Kunsten CMS (Fall 2024)

Third semester of the bachelor is about creating a well-designed system - so a lot of UML diagrams. In the semester it is also required to work with a third party to create or work on a system for/with them. Here we contacted [Kunsen Museum of Art](https://kunsten.dk/) which ended in us creating a content manamgent system for their display screens.
