# Enriching Dataset metadata (Fall 2025)

Wholehardedly the most boring project I have been part of.
The fifth semester of the software bachelor is about working with agile practices - so... SCRUM - in a multi-project, here [ODINI](https://odini.net/), with other groups across the semester, different studies, and with the prople of the organisation as well. 
Out focus was on incooporating metadata into the backend of ODINI, together with optimising some databse work. This involved a FastAPI backend, GCP (bigquery and storage buckets).

## Abstract

This project is part of the larger ODINI multiproject, a tool for marine research that concerns discovering and integrating oceanographic datasets from distributed sources.For the purpose of development, the project group worked within the agile software development framework, specifically scrum. The report describes the scrum approach and how the project group used it to plan and communicate within the group, as well as with other groups and stakeholders within ODINI.The group had, at the request of the stakeholders, been tasked with adding to and improving the ODINI platform, specifically its backend. The report details the design and implementation of metadata integration into the ODINI platform, a proposed restructuring of the relational database concerning the datasets as part of users’ dataset collections, and optimising the latency experienced by users when browsing search results during dataset discovery.All the features have been implemented, with the metadata integration and discovery prefetching to enter ODINI’s production, while the restructuring of the database still requires testing.
